<h1>KB Home</h1>
<h2>Flash/PHP/SQL Development</h2>
<p>KB Home is a large scale home builder who needed an intuitive interface for customers to choose floorplan options when buying a home.</p>

<p>This Flash-based kiosk system runs on dedicated stations in each sales office. KB Corporate uses an intranet backend to configure each kiosk for deployment. </p>

<p>A lighter version of the system runs at <a title="kbhome.com" href="http://kbhome.com" target="_blank">kbhome.com</a> and allows customers to preview floorplans and options online.  Currently over 1,000 floorplans are available to customize.</p>
