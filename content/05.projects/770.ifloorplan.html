<h2>Flash/PHP/SQL Development</h2>
<p>Interactive floorplans allow new home buyers to customize their home before it is built. iFloorPlan lets buyers visualize and manipulate structural options, electrical wiring and furniture placement. Home builders may then use these personalized floorplans as a starting guide for the construction process.</p>

<p>iFloorPlan has evolved through years of development into quite a sophisticated and flexible application, and is currently in use by dozens of the nation's top builders. The latest version introduces a completely new administration and production backend.</p>
